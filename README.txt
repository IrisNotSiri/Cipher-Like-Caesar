Encryption and Decryption rules:
The idea of the Caesar Cipher is to pick an integer and shift every letter of your message by that integer. In other words, suppose the shift is kth . Then, all instances of the i letter of the alphabet that appear in the plaintext should become the (i + k) th letter of the alphabet in the ciphertext. You will need to be careful with the case in which i + k > 26 (the length of the alphabet).
We will treat uppercase and lowercase letters individually, so that uppercase letters are always mapped to an uppercase letter, and lowercase letters are always mapped to a lowercase letter. If an uppercase letter maps to “A”, then the same lowercase letter should map to “a”. Punctuation and spaces should be retained and not changed. For example, a plaintext message with a comma should have a corresponding ciphertext with a comma in the same position.
